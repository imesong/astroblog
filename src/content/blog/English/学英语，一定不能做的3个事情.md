## 内容说明

这是*Power Learning English* 系列的**第二集**，englishanyone.com 出品。2013 年录制的视频，但其中提到的语言学习理念和方法，到现在仍然不过时。

## 内容大意

> 以下内容是根据我口述的中文文稿，经过 chatGPT 格式化调整后的内容。

## 放弃语法书

大家好，欢迎来到这个系列视频的第二集。今天，我们将讨论英语学习过程中你一定不能做的三件事。

首先，放弃使用语法书学习英语。这有两个关键点：第一，你应该以更加自然的方式学习语法；第二，你不需要知道每个语法点的名称。如果你问一个母语者什么是过去分词或分裂不定式，他们很可能无法回答，因为大多数母语者并不了解这些术语。你应该思考自己的母语学习过程，很多语法点你可能根本不记得，因为它们并不有趣。用语法书学习语法既不容易记住，也不必要。重要的是你要理解母语者在说什么，从而能够更顺畅地进行交流。

## 不要过分关注单词发音

第二，你需要停止对单个单词发音的过度关注。在YouTube或其他视频分享网站上，很多人尝试练习单词发音，例如“to”这个词。在句子中，这个词的发音会变化。作为英语学习者，你需要像母语者一样思考，并理解在短语或句子中学习单词。这将帮助你更快地提高流利度，因为它能让你理解一个单词在不同句子中的发音变化。你需要注意的是整个短语或词组，以及其中单词发音的变化。

## 先练习流利度，再考虑发音

最后，不要在能进行流畅交流之前过于担心发音。有很多学生希望在交流之前有完美的发音，但这是没有意义的。想想那些学母语的小孩子，他们可能需要四到五年甚至更长时间才能发音标准。对于英语学习者也是如此，尤其是母语与英语不同的学习者。因此，如果你想要流利地说英语并有好的发音，首先要开始多说、多练习。随着时间的推移，你的发音会逐渐改善。

记住这三点：不要担心语法规则，因为这些信息对你帮助不大，也会让你失去学习英语的兴趣；不要过分关注单个单词的发音，因为一个单词在不同句子中的发音会变化；在能进行流畅表达之前，不要过于担心发音。只要开始说，你的英语水平会逐步提高。

希望今天的视频对你有帮助。明天我们将教你两个关于如何思考以更快提高流利度的重要事项。明天见！

## Original English Script

Hello and welcome back to Lesson 2 in your free 7-day email video course from English Anyone. Com. I'm Drew Badger, and today you are going to learn three important things you should stop doing if you want to get fluent in real spoken English.

Remember from yesterday, first of all, that you should be thinking about your goals. Did you make your English vision board? I know you don't have to make one, but if you take the time to make a vision board, I promise you, you will be able to see your goal much much more clearly really think about what you want and then you will be able to achieve it easily.

Let's continue with today's lesson. The first most horrible thing you could do for your learning English is to try to master grammar using a grammar textbook. \*There are two things you need to remember about learning English grammar. The first thing is that you should learn grammar naturally . The second is that you do not need to know the names of grammar points. If go to ask a native speaker what a past participle is or a spilt infinitive is . They will not be able tell you, most native speakers do not know this information only an English teacher will be able to tell you what either of these two things are and this should give you some really import clue how to learn English naturally. Think about your own native language, you probably don't remember what you learned in school. It wan't very fun and you are trying to learn your own language grammar using a grammar textbook. You probably don't remember most of the names of the grammar points you studied . How did you learn grammar, you learn grammar naturally. We will teach you how to learn grammar later in this video series but for today just understand it will not helpful to study grammar using a grammar textbook . It won't be memorable, and you don't need to know that information. All you need to know is how to understand what native speakers are saying, so you can have a better conversation. But more about that in a later video lesson.

The second thing you need to stop doing is stop worrying about the pronunciation of individual words. On YouTube and other video sharing sites, we see a lot of people that are trying to practice pronunciation of individual words. As an example. The word "to" we use this one regularly when teaching students the word by itself usually has the pronunciation "tu", but in a larger sentence, the pronunciation of it changes. This is what you need to understand as a learner of English. You need to think like a native speaker and understand that you learn words in groups. This is how you get fluent in English much much faster because it helps you understand the pronunciation of one word _by comparing it or using it in a phrase or a group of words together in the example of 'to'. I can say I am going to the store pronunciation of 'to' become 'ti' . I am going 'tu' the store now the pronunciation of the word changes._ So what you need to be listening for are whole phrases, whole groups of words, and how that pronunciation affects the sound of one word within that group.

_The last thing you need to stop doing is worrying about your pronunciation before you can have a great conversation. I've seen so many students that really want to have great pronunciation before they can have a great conversation. This doesn't make any sense. Why would you want to worry about your pronunciation before you can even speak . Think about babies in your own language. Most young learners of your language it takes them maybe four or even five years or longer to learn how to pronounce your language using great normal pronunciation. The same thing is true for English learners especially if your language is different from English. So if you want to get fluent in real spoken English and have great pronunciation. Stop worrying about pronunciation. First begin talking, talk, talk, talk. Speak as much as you can and then you will begin to see real improvement in your pronunciation. It's boring and not helpful to try to practice pronunciation before you can speak._

Remember these three things: Don't worry about studying grammar rules because that information will not help you, and it will make you dislike learning English even more because it's not very fun. So throw the grammar book away. Also, remember to stop worrying about the pronunciation of individual words. _It's okay to study the pronunciation of individual words, so a word may have many sounds in it. Those sounds are import to study and that's why we teach phonics to students, but don't worry about project pronouncing or practicing one particular sound forward, because that sound will change , and finally don't worry about pronunciation before you can speak, even if you don't have great pronunciation , just speak and you will start seeing real improvement in your English much much faster_.

Well, I hope it's been another excellent video lesson for you today. Tomorrow we're going to teach you two really important things you need to understand about how to think in order to get fluid faster. So come back tomorrow, open your mail, watch the video lesson, and start speaking English much faster. Have an excellent day, think about your vision board, and we'll see you back here tomorrow.

## 补充 AI工具使用的问题

1. 这次对字幕处理的 prompt 做了更加详细的要求和示例补充，详细内容可以看参考资源的链接。整个 prompt 有 1500多个字符. But 使用下来效果并不好，出现了十分严重的 AI 自由发挥情况
   1. ChatGPT 没有免费额度了，前几十个段落的处理没有问题
   2. 通义千文，第一次处理陷入死循环，自己在处理 180 个段落是，重复输出相同的内容。手动停止后，它发现了自己的问题。尝试让它分多次处理整个文档，比如第一次处理 1-100 个段落，第二次处理 101-200 个段落。它清楚自己的任务和要求，但处理到第60个段落时，它就不知道自己要干嘛了，开始自由发挥。从160个段落自己跳到了218个段落，中间有大量的内容被删除。
2. 最后放弃对AI的调教，索性给AI，让它自己发挥，prompt 修改为

> 请忽略掉之前我们的指令要求，按照你自己的理解，将这份文档，修改为一份更容易让人类阅读的版本。我不是要你翻译，请使用原文中的英文表达。只是调整格式，不要改变意思。

勉强给出了一份能够使用的文档。在对比视频中的内容，仍然发现有成段落的文字被忽略了，原文中的英文稿中 _斜体_ 的部分为手动补充上。
