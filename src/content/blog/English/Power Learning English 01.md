## 内容说明

推荐一个英语学习的系列视频，englishanyone.com 出品。视频录制的比较早，2013 年录制的。但其中提到的语言学习理念和方法，到现在仍然不过时。

在介绍视频的具体内容之前，我还是想和大家分享一下，这篇文章的产出过程，编写这篇文章，也是一个比较有趣过程，探索如何使用AI ，在AI 的辅助下，提高写作效率。

![[power-learning-english-01-2024-07-11 12.34.30.excalidraw]]

下面是我个人根据自己理解，尝试用中文复述的视频大致内容。

## 主要内容概括

- 语言学习有多种方法，一种是以通过考试为主的，通过 notebook 学习，关注语法、词汇和写作技巧，以通过考试为目标；另一种是以真实的使用场景英语为主，通过一种更加自然的方式，类似婴儿学习母语的过程，在一种自然的环境中学习英语，多听、多说、多交流。
- 这里要介绍的是第二种英语学习方式，视频中称为 _real English_.
- 视频中提到的学习方法，不仅适用于英语学习，也可以学习其他语言。作者也是通过这种方式学习了日语。

## 内容大意

> 以下内容是根据我口述的中文文稿，经过 chatGPT 格式化调整后的内容。

### 视频介绍

这个视频共有八分钟，分为三段讲解其主要内容。第一段介绍了教程的主要内容。视频作者 Drew Badger 是 englishanyone.com 的创始人，这是他制作的一个免费的七天视频课程，主要通过邮件和视频进行学习。邮件中会包含相关文档，即视频的打印脚本，用户可以通过邮件中的视频进行学习。我是在 YouTube 上看到这个视频的。开场内容主要包括这些。

### 视频课程内容

下面是根据视频的字幕内容逐行逐句理解其意思。

本视频是一个七天免费的视频课程，感谢大家使用这个免费课程，非常高兴能够教授大家。这个优秀的邮件视频课程不仅教会特定的英语内容，还能通过邮件系统性地提升英语水平。你只需要打开每封邮件，观看视频，进行听力练习，阅读脚本，并反复进行这些步骤，从而吸收知识，使英语更加流畅。学习语言需要时间，最终你可以用英语交流，找到工作，并使用真实场景的英语。

### 学习目标与建议

作者分享了自己在日本学习英语的经历，并强调学习目标的重要性。他提到，大多数学生通过课本学习英语，缺乏目标与学习的关联。在课程中，用户需要明确学习目标，如通过考试、旅行或交友，并努力实现这些目标。课程结束后，作者会通过邮件提供建议和技巧，帮助用户继续学习，并制作自己的愿景图，记录未来的目标。在视频下方评论区提问，并继续学习以成为流畅的英语使用者。希望大家分享学习目标，互相帮助，实现目标。

The problem with most students of the English language is that they want to be able to speak with native speakers but they are learning textbook English. So maybe they have a goal but they are not connecting the goal with how they learn.
