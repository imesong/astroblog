## 背景介绍

在马来西亚期间，做的一个 presentation 的演讲稿。这也是第一次，尝试用英文做10分钟以上演讲。虽然主题比较简单、熟悉，但在演讲期间，还是出现了表达不完整、语气不连贯的情况。演讲的整个过程还是非常愉快、轻松的，把这个演讲稿整理出来，也是给自己留个纪念吧。

## 演讲稿内容

演讲稿非常简单，一共只有6页，第一页欢迎，第六页致谢，主要内容在 2-5 页。

<aside>
💡 My family is truly a treasure beyond measure, embodying love, responsibility, and harbor in my life.

</aside>

**Love**:

- The love I share with my wife and daughters is boundless.
- It's the force that binds us, supporting us through challenges.

**Responsibility**:

- Being a husband and father has taught me the profound meaning of responsibility.
- It's a duty I embrace wholeheartedly, knowing that my actions shape our family's world.
- This responsibility doesn't **weigh** me down -- it gives my life purpose and direction.

**Harbour**

- In the storms of life, my family is my safe harbour
- I find peace, understanding, and unconditional acceptance.
- No matter what the world throws at us, I know we have a safe place

This gift of family - of love, responsibility, and harbour - is the greatest treasure I could ever hope for.
